This is an extremely simple game that is not very fun tbh. I could have made it more fun but decided I didn't want to spend too much time on this.

The game is the very first entry in a series of games that I hope to complete. Taken from ["I need Practice Programming"](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/) blog post from the "The Invent with Python Blog". My personal approach is to not read the supplied source code or any reference material linked to for each game. I want my implementations to be as "original" as possible so that I can learn by trial and error.

As the post puts it, the games description is as follows:

"Description: Several bad guys fall from the top of the screen, and the user must avoid them. The player can be controlled with the arrow keys or more directly with the mouse. The longer the player lasts without being hit, the higher the score."

I did not add in a score multiplier however, you simply receive one point for each enemy destroyed.

The explosion sprite is from an excellent free FX pack on itch.io by @SxWxSGame, [check it out here](https://ppeldo.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-game-spellmagic-fx)
